## Project Structure

The project follows a simple structure:

/tech-blog
|-- /assets
| |-- favicon.ico
|-- /css
| |-- style.css
|-- /js
| |-- script.js
|-- 404.html
|-- index.html
|-- README.md


- **`index.html`**: Main homepage of the website.
- **`404.html`**: Custom 404 page when a user tries to visit a non-existing page.
- **`style.css`**: All styles for the website, including light/dark mode, responsiveness, etc.
- **`script.js`**: JavaScript file that handles dynamic features like the search box, theme toggle, routing, etc.
- **`favicon.ico`**: A favicon for the website.

## Features and Functionality

### Theme Toggle (Dark Mode)
The website features a **Dark Mode** toggle button that switches between a light theme and dark theme, making it more accessible and enjoyable for users in different lighting environments.

- **Light Mode**: Default mode with light background and dark text.
- **Dark Mode**: A toggleable dark theme for users who prefer it for better readability and less eye strain.

### Page Routing (Hash Navigation)
The site uses **hash navigation** to switch between pages (Home, About, Blog, Contact). It updates the content dynamically without reloading the page, providing a smoother user experience.

### Search Functionality
Users can filter blog posts by typing in the **search box**. The posts are filtered in real-time, showing only the ones that match the search term.

### Footer & Back to Top Button
The footer contains the copyright and year information, dynamically updated using JavaScript. A **Back to Top** button appears once the user scrolls down and allows them to return to the top of the page smoothly.
